# CSE151A_Pokemon_Classification

## EDA:
- Bar Graph on the frequency of each class, winged and not winged done 
- Plot Dimensions of images (hist) done 
- Plot a few images after resizing done 
- Case study on background diversity 
- Case study on different “types” of visual representations of the pokemon (cartoon, 3D, pokemon card, drawing, etc)
- Embedding plot (visual similarities in Pokemon)
- Visualize Data augmentation

## Data Preprocessing:
- Make a csv file that maps pokemon name to (winged or not winged) (25 each person) done 
- Resize the images (224 x 224) done 
- Grayscale the images done 
- Normalize the pixel values done 
- Train/Val/Test splits/Cross-validation done 
- Data Augmentation 
- Flattening the Image (Logistic Regression)

## Model Training
### KNN
### CNN
- Experiment with architecture (ResNet-18, ResNet-54)
- Experiment with Optimizers (Adam, RMSProp, AMSGrad)
- Experiment with batch size (32, 64)
- Experiment with Epochs (25, 50)
